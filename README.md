## QueryScope
A native looking test suite made in PySide: A Python binding of the cross-platform GUI toolkit

## Description
Is an application designed to test and refine XPath queries for use in Mellisa, a web crawler framework. It allows users to evaluate XPath expressions against crawled web pages, ensuring accurate data extraction. This helps users optimize their XPath queries for better precision and performance within the Mellisa framework.

## Features (Planned)  
- Test XPath queries on web pages crawled by Mellisa.  
- Highlight matched elements in parsed HTML/XML.  
- Display performance metrics like execution time and match count.  
- Provide graph-based visualizations for query efficiency.  

## Overview  
**QueryScope** is a test suite designed to evaluate and optimize XPath queries used in **Mellisa**, a web crawler framework. It helps users refine XPath expressions by providing real-time feedback, highlighting matched elements, and visualizing performance metrics for each queries feed in the application.
